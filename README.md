# ListArray
This is a linear data structure similar to that of a Linked-List, however, each node of the structure contains an array. This structure supports dynamic resizing in cases of addition/removal of elements when appropriate. The data structure was created in April of 2023 as a class project, but I have since revisited it and rewritten a majority of the codebase to be more efficient. I am aware there are some edge cases that need to be reworked, it is a work in progress.
