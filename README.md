# ListArray
This is a linear data structure similar to that of a linked list, where each node is composed of arrays. This data structure supports dynamic resizing upon removal/addition of elements.
This is a revised/updated version of my older ListArray I created for a class project. WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!
